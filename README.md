# YoutubeDownloaderCommandLine
A command line tool that scrapes the youtube search results and displays them in an orderly fashion. After a video is chosen the video will be downloaded using the youtube-dl library. It will than be converted to an MP3 using ffmpeg. 

Downloading the MP4 and manually converting it to an MP3 provided way better audio quality over only downloading the audio stream from the video. The MP4 will automatically be deleted after converting :)
